"For non-core products â€” which are the products that WooCommerce does not group under simple, external, variable, or groups â€” there are a plethora of new editing options! You can now change the image, name, description, read-only price, read-only inventory, tags, short description, and product settings.\n"

"Our core products also have additional fields that can be edited â€” tags, categories, product type, enable/ disable reviews, and visibility.\n"
"\n"
"We also have an update for Apple Sign In â€” if you disconnect Apple ID from the WordPress app (Settings > Apple ID > Password & Security > Apps using Apple ID) the app will log out when you launch, or if you switch between apps. So you wonâ€™t stay logged in if you donâ€™t want to!\n"
