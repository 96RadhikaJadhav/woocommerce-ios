"Push notifications and update badges work better together. The Reviews tab no longer shows a badge after you receive a new order push notification, and navigating to the Orders and/or the Reviews tab now clears the badge number (depending on the types of notifications).\n"

"Nudges are a bit less nudge-y. When editing products, the ‚Äúdiscard changes‚Äù prompt now only appears if you‚Äôve deleted images, and not when you‚Äôre leaving product settings detail screens with a text field (slug, purchase note, and menu order).\n"

"We also straightened out a few little UI foibles:\n"
"- The product name displays in the product details navigation bar, so it‚Äôs always visible.\n"
"- We fixed an issue that prevented the product details from scrolling all the way to the bottom in landscape mode after dismissing the keyboard.\n"
"- Images pending upload will be visible after editing product images from product details.\n"
"- The ‚ÄúView product in store‚Äù action displays only if the product is published.\n"
"- HTML codes in the shipping method are now shown correctly.\n"
