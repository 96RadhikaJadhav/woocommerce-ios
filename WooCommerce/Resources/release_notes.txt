- The tab formerly known as Notifications is now Reviews. As notifications are now shown under Orders, the Notifications tab was in need of a new identity. We have cunningly renamed it ‘Reviews,’ as it now just shows reviews.
- We have fixed a bug where pulling down to refresh on the Order Details screen resulted in weird UI with misplaced labels.
- A badge is now displayed in the bottom tab, overlapping the Orders icon, to indicate the number of orders processing.
