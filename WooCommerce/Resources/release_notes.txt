* Do you use the Shipment Tracking plugin? Now you can manually add shipment tracking to orders.
* Sometimes when you’d try to view your store’s Top Performers you’d get an “Unable to load content” error, which was an ironic lack of top performance on the app’s part. That’s fixed now.

* Occasionally, the app would crash when it had a slow network connection. Now it doesn’t, because iffy wifi should never stop you from managing your business.
