## Coding Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

#### Protocols

When naming protocols, we generally follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#strive-for-fluent-usage):

- Protocols that describe _what something_ is should read as nouns (e.g. `Collection`).
- Protocols that describe a _capability_ should be named using the suffixes `able`, `ible`, or `ing` (e.g. `Equatable`, `ProgressReporting`).

For protocols that are specifically for one type only, it is acceptable to append `Protocol` to the name.

```swift
public protocol ProductsRemoteProtocol { }

final class ProductsRemote: Remote, ProductsRemoteProtocol { }
```

We usually end up with cases like this when we _have_ to create a protocol to support mocking unit tests.

#### String Constants in Nested Enums

When a class/struct that contains localization, we generally group the string constants in a nested enum called `Localization`. In the past, we had other names like `Constants` or `Strings` and it is fine to leave them and follow this naming for new code. For example:

```swift
final class ViewController: UIViewController {
    enum Localization {
        static let title = NSLocalizedString("Products", comment: "Navigation bar title of the products tab.")
    }
}
```

#### Test Methods

Contrary to the standard [Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) style in Swift functions, test methods should use [Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). We concluded that this helps with readability especially since test methods can be quite long.

**Preferred:**

```swift
func test_tapping_ScheduleSaleToRow_toggles_PickerRow_in_Sales_section()
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
func testTappingScheduleSaleToRowTogglesPickerRowInSalesSection()
```

Note that when referring to a property or a class, we can still use the appropriate Camel or Pascal case for it.

Also, consider writing the test method name in a way that incorporates these three things:

1. What operation are we testing
2. Under what circumstances
3. What is the expected result?

For example:

```swift
func test_evolvePokemon_when_passed_a_Pikachu_then_it_returns_Raichu()
```

Please refer to [Unit Test Naming: The 3 Most Important Parts](https://qualitycoding.org/unit-test-naming/) for some rationale on why this can be a good idea.



### Coding Style

The guidelines for how Swift should be written and formatted can be found in the [Coding Style Guide](coding-style-guide.md).



### Choosing Between Structures and Classes

In addition to the [Apple guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/choosing_between_structures_and_classes), we generally prefer to use `struct` for:

- Value types like the [Networking Models](../Networking/Networking/Model)
- Stateless helpers

But consider using `class` instead if:

- You need to manage mutable states. Especially if there are more than a few `mutating` functions, the `struct` becomes harder to reason about.
- You have to set a `struct` property declaration as `var` because it has a `mutating` function. In this case, a constant (`let`) `class` property may be easier to reason about.



## Design Patterns

### Copiable

In the WooCommerce module, we generally work with [immutable objects](../Yosemite/Yosemite/Model/Model.swift). Mutation only happens within Yosemite and Storage. This is an intentional design and promotes clarity of [where and when those objects will be updated](https://git.io/JvALp).

But in order to _update_ something, we still need to pass an _updated_ object to Yosemite. For example, to use the [`ProductAction.updateProduct`](../Yosemite/Yosemite/Actions/ProductAction.swift) action, we'd probably have to create a new [`Product`](../Networking/Networking/Model/Product/Product.swift) object:

```swift
// An existing Product instance given by Yosemite
let currentProduct: Product

// Update the Product instance with a new `name`
let updatedProduct = Product(
    productID: currentProduct.productID,
    name: "A new name", // The only updated property
    slug: currentProduct.slug,
    permalink: currentProduct.permalink,
    dateCreated: currentProduct.dateCreated,
    dateModified: currentProduct.dateModified,
    dateOnSaleStart: currentProduct.dateOnSaleStart,

    // And so on...
)

let action = ProductAction.updateProduct(product: updatedProduct, ...)
store.dispatch(action)
```

This is quite cumbersome, especially since `Product` has more than 50 properties.

To help with this, we generate `copy()` methods for these objects. These `copy()` methods follow a specific pattern and will make use of the [`CopiableProp` and `NullableCopiableProp` typealiases](../Networking/Networking/Copiable/Copiable.swift).

Here is an example implementation on a `Person` `struct`:

```swift
struct Person {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let address: String?
}

/// This will be automatically generated
extension Person {
    func copy(
        id: CopiableProp<Int> = .copy,
        name: CopiableProp<String> = .copy,
        address: NullableCopiableProp<String> = .copy
    ) -> Person {
        // Create local variables to reduce Swift compilation complexity.
        let id = id ?? self.id
        let name = name ?? self.name
        let address = address ?? self.address

        return Person(
            id: id
            name: name
            address: address
        )
    }
}
```

The `copy()` arguments match the `Person`'s properties. For the `Optional` properties like `address`, the `NullableCopiableProp` typealias is used.

By default, not passing any argument would only create a _copy_ of the `Person` instance. Passing an argument would _replace_ that property's value:

```swift
let luke = Person(id: 1, name: "Luke", address: "Jakku")

let leia = luke.copy(name: "Leia")
```

In the above, `leia` would have the same `id` and `address` as `luke` because those arguments were not given.

```swift
{ id: 1, name: "Leia", address: "Jakku" }
```

The `address` property, declared as `NullableCopiableProp<String>` has an additional functionality. Because it is `Optional`, we should be able to set its value to `nil`. We can do that by passing an `Optional` variable as the argument:

```swift
let luke = Person(id: 1, name: "Luke", address: "Jakku")

let address: String? = nil

let lukeWithNoAddress = luke.copy(address: address)
```

The `lukeWithNoAddress` variable will have a `nil` address as expected:

```swift
{ id: 1, name: "Luke", address: nil }
```

If we want to _directly_ set the `address` to `nil`, we should **not** pass just `nil`. This is because `nil` is just the same as `.copy` in this context. Instead, we should pass `.some(nil)` instead.

```swift
let luke = Person(id: 1, name: "Luke", address: "Jakku")

// DO NOT
// Result will be incorrect: { id: 1, name: "Luke", address: "Jakku" }
let lukeWithNoAddress = luke.copy(address: nil)

// DO
// Result will be { id: 1, name: "Luke", address: nil }
let lukeWithNoAddress = luke.copy(address: .some(nil))
```

### Generating Copiable Methods

The `copy()` methods are generated using [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery). For now, only the classes or structs in the WooCommerce, Yosemite, and Networking modules are supported.

To generate a `copy()` method for a `class` or `struct`:

1. Make it conform to [`GeneratedCopiable`](../Networking/Networking/Copiable/GeneratedCopiable.swift). Consider importing the `protocol` only.

    ```swift
    import protocol Networking.GeneratedCopiable

    struct ProductSettings: GeneratedCopiable {
        ...
    }
    ```

2. In terminal, navigate to the project's root folder and run `rake generate`.

    ```
    $ cd /path/to/root
    $ rake generate
    ```

    This will generate separate files for every module. For example:

    ```
    WooCommerce/Classes/Copiable/Models+Copiable.generated.swift
    Yosemite/Yosemite/Model/Copiable/Models+Copiable.generated.swift
    ```

3. Add the generated files to the appropriate project if they're not added yet.
4. Compile the project.

### Modifying The Copiable Code Generation

The [`rake generate`](../Rakefile) command executes the Sourcery configuration files located in the [`CodeGeneration` folder](../CodeGeneration). There are different configuration files for every module:

```
Networking module → Networking-Copiable.sourcery.yaml
WooCommerce module → WooCommerce-Copiable.sourcery.yaml
Yosemite module → Yosemite-Copiable.sourcery.yaml
```

All of them use a single template, [`Models+Copiable.swifttemplate`](../CodeGeneration/Models+Copiable.swifttemplate), to generate the code. It's written using [Swift templates](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/writing-templates.html).

Please refer to the [Sourcery reference](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/index.html) for more info about how to write templates.

### Tracking Events

To add a new event, the event name has to be added as a `case` in the [`WooAnalyticsStat` enum](../WooCommerce/Classes/Analytics/WooAnalyticsStat.swift). Tracking the event looks like this:

```swift
final class ViewController {
    private let analytics: Analytics

    init(analytics: Analytics = ServiceLocator.analytics) {
        self.analytics = analytics
    }

    private func onUpdateButtonPress() {
        analytics.track(.productDetailUpdateButtonTapped)
    }
}
```

Having the `String` values in the `WooAnalyticsStat` enum helps us with comparing the events being tracked in WooCommerce Android.

#### Custom Properties

If the event has custom properties, add a corresponding `static func` [`WooAnalyticsEvent`](../WooCommerce/Classes/Analytics/WooAnalyticsEvent.swift) constructor of the event. Add the custom properties as parameters of the function. For example:

```swift
extension WooAnalyticsEvent {

    public enum AppFeedbackPromptAction: String {
        case shown
        case liked
        case didntLike = "didnt_like"
    }

    static func appFeedbackPrompt(action: AppFeedbackPromptAction) -> WooAnalyticsEvent {
        WooAnalyticsEvent(statName: .appFeedbackPrompt,
                          properties: ["action": action.rawValue])
    }
}
```

Tracking the event would now look like this:

```swift
analytics.track(event: .appFeedbackPrompt(action: .liked))
```

Organizing events and their custom properties this way helps us with:

- Answering what custom properties are available for an event and what the valid values are.
- Decreasing the risk of costly typos. A typo in an event name or its property would set us back in analyzing the correct data.
