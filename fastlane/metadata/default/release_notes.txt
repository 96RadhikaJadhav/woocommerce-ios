We’re continuing to add functionality to product editing. Look out for improvements to image and product management — head to “Settings” in the My Store tab to learn more and turn on the new features!

Push notifications and update badges work better together. The Reviews tab no longer shows a badge after you receive a new order push notification, and navigating to the Orders and/or the Reviews tab now clears the badge number (depending on the types of notifications).

Nudges are a bit less nudge-y. When editing products, the “discard changes” prompt now only appears if you’ve deleted images, and not when you’re leaving product settings detail screens with a text field (slug, purchase note, and menu order).

We also straightened out a few little UI foibles:
- The product name displays in the product details navigation bar, so it’s always visible.
- We fixed an issue that prevented the product details from scrolling all the way to the bottom in landscape mode after dismissing the keyboard.
- Images pending upload will be visible after editing product images from product details.
- The “View product in store” action displays only if the product is published.
- HTML codes in the shipping method are now shown correctly.
