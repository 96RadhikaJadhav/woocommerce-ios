* Fixed! The footer in the app's Settings is now centered, draft products now sort from "Newest to Oldest" as expected, and the white background color has been removed from the placeholder view in the top dashboard chart in dark mode on iOS 14.
* Enhanced! Use the new date picker in iOS 14 to edit the date shipped in order details > add tracking and edit sale dates in details > price setting. Also, you'll see a "No Title" placeholder for products without a title in the products list.
