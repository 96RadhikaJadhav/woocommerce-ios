In this update, we have a lot of new possibilities for editing your products to report.

For non-core products — which are the products that WooCommerce does not group under simple, external, variable, or groups — there are a plethora of new editing options! You can now change the image, name, description, read-only price, read-only inventory, tags, short description, and product settings.

You can also now edit variable products, and stock status is included in the variation list.

Our core products also have additional fields that can be edited — tags, categories, product type, enable/ disable reviews, and visibility.

We also have an update for Apple Sign In — if you disconnect Apple ID from the WordPress app (Settings > Apple ID > Password & Security > Apps using Apple ID) the app will log out when you launch, or if you switch between apps. So you won’t stay logged in if you don’t want to!
