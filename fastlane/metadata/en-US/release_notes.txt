- Products: If the Products switch is on in Settings → Experimental Features for a variable product, the stock status is no longer shown in the product details when stock management is disabled (since stock status is controlled at variation level).
- Orders: The search list will now show the full count instead of “99+”.
- Reviews: We’ve fixed an issue where reviews were not refreshing correctly. Now, if you delete or mark a review as spam, this change will be reflected in the product reviews list.
