- This update is all about improved reliability and fixes:
- Improved localization support on My Store charts and on the Orders & Notifications screens.
- The app now hides orders that have a created date listed in the future. (They no longer display under the “Today” section of an order list.)
- We’ve removed the payment method summary in the payment section when no payment has been received.
- Taxes line is now shown in payments and product details even when the amount to show is zero.
- When logging out, the app now resets the credential used with support requests.
