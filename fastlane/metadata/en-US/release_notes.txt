New alerts: When a simple product doesn’t have a price set, an “Add Price” placeholder shows up on the product details screen in the price row. App users who haven’t yet upgraded to WooCommerce 4.0 will see a banner indicating an upgrade available. Users who have already upgraded will see the new stats dashboard. If you haven’t yet upgraded, we encourage you to do so!

Fixes and adjustments: We fixed a bug where a negative value could result in a visual glitch appearing on the dashboard charts. We also removed the total orders row from the Products tab to avoid confusion since we aren’t showing it on the editable form for simple products.
